# Group 11 Final project 2022

Final project for the 22100 R for Bio Data Science course at DTU. The project has been carried out by the students:

- Dalsberg Jørgensen, Jonas - s213551 
- Gutierrez Leon, Alvaro - s212714 
- Hoang Viet Minh Pham, Jake - s213060

## Introduction

## Data

The dataset used in the projects consists of miRNA expression data for 76 esophageal cancer patients from the US and Japan. It was generated and published by [Mathé et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19789312/) and retireved from the [GEO website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13937).

## Objectives

Here we aim to reproduce the findings of the authors and elaborate on their visualizations.

## Pipeline

The pipeline of data rpocessing is summarised in the flowchart:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
